Understand the Economics of Football by Analyzing International Transfers Data in Excel

This project analyzes football player transfers across different associations, spanning two seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023). It utilizes Excel functions to gain insights into the global football economy, making it ideal for football fans and data enthusiasts alike.

Key Tasks Performed:

1.Data Preprocessing and Manipulation:

Cleaned and organized raw transfer data for two seasons.
Defined data types (e.g., player names, transfer fees, countries) for accurate analysis.
Created calculated columns or used formulas to derive additional insights (e.g., net transfer movement).

2.Filtering and PivotTables:

Filtered data based on specific criteria (e.g., transfer fees above a certain threshold, specific countries).
Utilized PivotTables to summarize transfer activity by country, league, or club.

3.Formula Usage:

Employed various Excel functions (e.g., SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, COUNTIF) to calculate:
Total transfer fees for incoming and outgoing transfers.
Net transfer movement (money spent vs. received) for each club/country.
Average transfer fees for different positions or leagues.

4.Data Visualization:
Created  graphs to visualize key findings:
Top spender and receiver clubs/countries.
Distribution of transfer fees by player positions.
Net transfer movement trends over two seasons.
